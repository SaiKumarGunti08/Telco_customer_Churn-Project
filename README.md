# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze customer churn in a telecommunication company using an exploratory data analysis (EDA) approach. Customer churn refers to the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity. By identifying patterns and insights in the dataset, we aim to understand the factors influencing churn and provide actionable recommendations.

## Objectives

1. *Understand the Dataset:* Perform a thorough exploration of the dataset to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies.
2. *Identify Key Factors:* Determine the features most correlated with customer churn.
3. *Visualize Insights:* Create visualizations to effectively communicate findings.
4. *Prepare for Predictive Modeling:* Ensure the dataset is clean and insights are ready for further modeling.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes information about a telecommunications company's customers, their demographics, services, and account details. Key columns include:

- *CustomerID:* Unique identifier for each customer.
- *Demographics:* Gender, age, and other personal details.
- *Services:* Types of services subscribed (e.g., internet, phone, TV).
- *Account Information:* Contract type, tenure, charges, and payment methods.
- *Churn:* Binary indicator of whether the customer has left (Yes/No).

## Features of the Project

1. *Data Cleaning:*

   - Handled missing values and incorrect data types.
   - Standardized categorical variables for analysis.

2. *Exploratory Data Analysis:*

   - Univariate analysis to understand individual feature distributions.
   - Bivariate and multivariate analysis to explore relationships between features and churn.

3. *Visualizations:*

   - Bar charts and histograms for categorical and numerical data.
   - Correlation heatmaps to highlight significant relationships.
   - Boxplots to identify outliers and compare churn patterns.

4. *Insights:*

   - Identification of key features impacting churn (e.g., tenure, monthly charges, contract type).
   - Behavioral patterns of customers likely to churn.

5. *Recommendations:*

   - Strategies to reduce churn based on identified factors.

## Tools and Technologies

- *Programming Language:* Python
- *Libraries:* Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- *Environment:* Jupyter Notebook

## Results

- *Key Findings:*

  - Customers with shorter tenures and higher monthly charges are more likely to churn.
  - Contract type and payment methods play significant roles in churn behavior.
  - Customers with month-to-month contracts are at higher risk.

- *Visualizations:*

  - Churn distribution by demographic and service attributes.
  - Correlation of numerical features with churn.
  - Trend analysis of churn behavior over time.

## Future Work

- Extend the project to build a predictive model for customer churn.
- Test various machine learning algorithms for classification.
- Develop a dashboard to track churn metrics in real-time.
